# Knozify Backend

Knozify is a modern social media platform designed to connect users through engaging content and seamless interactions. This repository contains the backend for Knozify, built with Django, which powers the core functionality of the platform.

The backend is responsible for handling all API calls required by the frontend applications (built with React.js for web and React Native for mobile). Key features managed by this backend include:

- **Authentication:** Secure user login and registration.
- **Content Management:** Upload and management of videos, images, and other media.
- **User Management:** Handling user profiles, followers, and social interactions.
- **API Endpoints:** Providing robust and scalable APIs for frontend consumption.

This backend serves as the foundation for both the headless website and mobile app, ensuring a consistent and reliable experience across platforms.
